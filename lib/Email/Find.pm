=head1 NAME

  Email::Find - Find RFC 822 email addresses in plain text


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Email::Find;
  $num_found = find_emails($text, \&callback);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a module for finding a I<subset> of RFC 822 email addresses in
arbitrary text (L<CAVEATS>).  The addresses it finds are not
guaranteed to exist or even actually be email addresses at all
(L<CAVEATS>), but they will be valid RFC 822 syntax.

Email::Find will perform some heuristics to avoid some of the more
obvious red herrings and false addresses, but there's only so much
which can be done without a human.


=head2 Functions

Email::Find exports one function, find_emails().  It works very
similar to URI::Find's find_uris().

  $num_emails_found = find_emails($text, \&callback);

The first argument is a block of text for find_emails to search
through and manipulate.  Second is a callback routine which defines
what to do with each email as they're found.  It returns the total
number of emails found.

The callback is given two arguments.  The first is a Mail::Address
object representing the address found.  The second is the actual
original email as found in the text.  Whatever the callback returns
will replace the original text.


=head1 EXAMPLES

  # Simply print out all the addresses found leaving the text undisturbed.
  find_emails($text, sub {
                         my($email, $orig_email) = @_;
                         print "Found ".$email->format."\n";
                         return $orig_email;
                     });


  # For each email found, ping its host to see if its alive.
  require Net::Ping;
  $ping = Net::Ping->new;
  my %Pinged = ();
  find_emails($text, sub {
                         my($email, $orig_email) = @_;
                         my $host = $email->host;
                         next if exists $Pinged{$host};
                         $Pinged{$host} = $ping->ping($host);
                     });

  while( my($host, $up) = each %Pinged ) {
      print "$host is ". $up ? 'up' : 'down' ."\n";
  }


  # Count how many addresses are found.
  print "Found ", find_emails($text, sub { return $_[1] }), " addresses\n";


  # Wrap each address in an HTML mailto link.
  find_emails($text, sub {
                         my($email, $orig_email) = @_;
                         my($address) = $email->format;
                         return qq|<a href="mailto:$address">$orig_email</a>|;
                     });

=item Why a subset of RFC 822?

I say that this module finds a I<subset> of RFC 822 because if I
attempted to look for I<all> possible valid RFC 822 addresses I'd wind
up practically matching the entire block of text!  The complete
specification is so wide open that its difficult to construct
soemthing that's I<not> an RFC 822 address.

To keep myself sane, I look for the 'address spec' or 'global address'
part of an RFC 822 address.  This is the part which most people
consider to be an email address (the 'foo@bar.com' part) and it is
also the part which contains the information necessary for delivery.

=item Why are some of the matches not email addresses?

Alas, many things which aren't email addresses I<look> like email
addresses and parse just fine as them.  The biggest headache is email
and usenet message IDs.  I do my best to avoid them, but there's only
so much cleverness you can pack into one library.

=item This module requires 5.005_63 or higher!

This module runs so slow as to be unusable with 5.005 stable.  I'm not
sure, but it might be because I build up my search regex using lots of
compiled regexes.  Either way, it runs orders of magnitude faster
under 5.005_63.

Perhaps in later versions I'll be able to tweak it to be efficient
with 5.005 stable.
